# Introduction

D2 is a declarative diagram language: describe intent, let renderer produce layout.

Use this skill for:

- architecture diagrams
- service dependencies
- class and sequence diagrams
- SQL-like schema visuals
- presentation/storyboard diagrams via composition

Guiding principle:

1. start minimal and valid
2. improve readability
3. apply customization intentionally
4. export to target medium
