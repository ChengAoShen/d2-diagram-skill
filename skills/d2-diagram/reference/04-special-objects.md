# Special Objects

Covers:

- Markdown text and code blocks (`text`, `shape: text`)
- Icons and images (`icon: URL`, `shape: image`)
- SQL tables
- UML classes
- Sequence diagrams
- Grid diagrams

Rule of thumb:

- Use special objects when semantic meaning matters.
- Keep labels concise; move large detail to markdown/code blocks.
